# Parameters for gtsam_slam_node

# Input topics: can be a single string or a list of strings.
# Use absolute topics (starting with '/') or relative ones resolved in the node's namespace.
pointcloud_topics:
  - mapping/scan_pointcloud
  - mapping/range_pointcloud

# Output topic for odometry (published as nav_msgs/Odometry).
# If left without a leading '/', it will be resolved relative to the node's namespace.
odometry_topic: slam/odometry

# TF frames used by the node.
# These mirror the launch defaults so configuration can live in one place.
# The launch file may still override these via <param>, but keeping them here
# makes the parameters discoverable and easier to manage.
map_frame: map
base_frame: barracuda/base_link

# OctoMap resolution (meters per voxel in the occupancy tree).
# Used as default leaf size for point cloud downsampling if not set explicitly.
octomap_resolution: 0.25

# Point cloud downsampling before inserting into OctoMap.
# When enabled, a PCL VoxelGrid filter reduces points by replacing points
# within a voxel with their centroid, greatly speeding up OctoMap insertion.
downsample_enabled: true
# Leaf size (meters) for the VoxelGrid. If omitted, defaults to octomap_resolution.
downsample_leaf_size: 0.25
